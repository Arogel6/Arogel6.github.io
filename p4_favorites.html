	<p>  <strong> The Wild Robot  </strong>
	<br>
	This Book was published April 5, 2016 its Author and Illustrator 
	is Peter Brown
	<br><br>
	 This book is my favirote becasue it was the first book i was genuinely intrested in as a kid.
	 It was on the topic of animals and technology wich i love animals and at the time technology was intresting to me and now i love it.
	 This book shows how people can be outcasts but you just need to get to know them to know they are actually just like you.
	 The book has alwasy make me feel at home and now has its own movie and im glad its getting the recognition it deserves because all the people i've meet so far dosent know the book.
	 but im glad with the movie i can now share how this book made me feel with other kids.

	<br>
	<pre><Strong> not the perfect mexican daughter  </strong>
	<br>
	 This book was originally published on October 17, 2017 the Author is Erika Sanchez
	<br><br>
	 This book it one of my favirotes because the story is almost exactly like my life i relate to it so much and this book makes me cry because of it.
	 i would defenitly read it again its so good it starts off kind of boring but the deeper you go into it the better it gets and i relate because of the culture, the steryotypes, how they live life, there way of thinking, and there living situation.
	 this book inspires me and i hope in the future they make a movie out of it because this book holds my heart.

	<br>
	 
	<p>  <strong> McFarland, USA </strong>
	<br>
	 This movie is 2h and 9m it was released June 2, 2015 and directed by Niki Caro
	<br><br>
	 This is on of my favirote movies because it never fails to make me feel sad.
	 This movie makes me realize people have harder lives and sports genuinely brings people together.  
	 Also them being hispanic i can relate to there traditions and the steryotypes and family situations.
	<br><br>
	 This movie is also a true story and i feel like they made this movie beautifuly because it defenetly touched a bunch of people hearts.
	 This movie makes me feel like i can acomplish things and can do better.

	<h3 id='m2'> Fav#2 - movie  </h3>
	<br>
	<pre><p><strong> Under The Same Moon </strong></P>
	<br>
	 This movie is 1h and 49m it was released March 19, 2008 and directed by Patricia Riggen
	<br><br>
	 This is also one of my favirote movies because i always end up crying to it.
	 This movie is also mainly hispanic characters and revolves around being hispanic.
	 So i relate to it more because its also my culture but also show how people have it harder.
	 it also makes it sader because the main character is a child that shouldent have to go through what he goes through.
	<br><br>
	 Its about a young mexican boy that travels illegally to the U.S. in order to reconnect with his mom and his mom dosent know about it.
	 i feel like many hispanics that live in mexico can relate to this because many of their family members travel to the U.S. and miss them 
	 a bunch and all of them dream for something better in their lives.
